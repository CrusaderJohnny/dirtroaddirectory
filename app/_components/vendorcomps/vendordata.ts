We are proud to produce not only great tasting carrots but several other vegetables as well. With the next generation joining us in the management of the farm, we plan to keep producing local, high quality produce for many years to come. Our produce can be found at farmers markets in Central Alberta and Calgary at the Innisfail Growers Booth. Produce can also be purchased at our farm."
